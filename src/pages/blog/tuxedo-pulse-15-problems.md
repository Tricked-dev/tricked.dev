This will be a short blog post i decided to make after the SSD that came with the laptop failed hard enough to make it useless, it was kinda unstable before but now i can't update and i properly diagnosed the issue to a controller failure, My laptop came with a Kingston m.2 and it seems like they stopped selling them.

I bought the tuxedo pulse 15 gen1 around Sat, Mar 12, 2022, since then i have had the following issues with it:

- USB-C charging is broken charges for ~1m/45s then stops charging, i am not using a 95 watt charger but i'd expect at-least some charging from 27watt/33watt/65watt chargers
- SSD faulty since start and completely broke 3 years after purchase support refuses to replace it as it's no longer under warranty
  - SSD's usually have around 3-5 years of warranty and the ssd i got on this laptop was upgraded from the base model im pretty sure so i would expect warranty on just that to be a little longer
- tuxedo software is a pita to deal with on Archlinux AND nixos - honestly not sure if its worth installing i was hoping to see more progress from [tuxedo-rs](https://github.com/AaronErhardt/tuxedo-rs) but they seem to have stalled.
- screen frame on my model's bottom left corner points out and can be pushed back in but will return to being slightly pointed out every time
- bios battery expired within 3 years of using
- to open the laptop you need to open 8 screws and a bunch of clips (clips being known for being brittle dell, the dell latitude i have also required 8 screws with 0 clips)
- anti slip rubber on the bottom of the laptop is detaching
- F8 key broke was able to get a replacement mailed in luckily

condensed version of all my issues the updatedAt date will be displayed on this post if any changes arrive - I created a support ticket and almost instantly got the ssd replacement denied.
