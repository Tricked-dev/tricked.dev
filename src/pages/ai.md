All content is at least 95% written by me and sometimes i ask ai to fix typos / guide me to make more logical sentences. For code i heavily use Claude Code as it less mentally straining at the end of the day and gives quick results i often have to default back to writing my own code though. I exclusively use Claude for personal use as its the most privacy preserving to quality ratio tool i know.

Blog post images can be created with ai although i prefer screenshots when possible & satisfying.
