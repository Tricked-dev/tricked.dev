## About me

Hi there! My name is Tricked and I am a software developer from the Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±. I have been passionate about programming and technology since I was 14 years old, starting with creating Javascript Discord bots.

Since then, I have gained experience in building a wide range of applications, including websites, user applications, and backends. I am currently focusing on using Rust & Typescript using svelte for frontend for most of my projects, Open to use other languages when best suited or required for a contribution.

I am currently working 4 days per week at a C# & Azure company.
