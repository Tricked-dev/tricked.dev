## About me

Hi there! My name is Tricked and I am a software developer from the Netherlands 🇳🇱. I have been passionate about programming and technology since I was 14 years old, starting with creating Javascript Discord bots.

Since then, I have gained experience in building a wide range of applications, including websites, user applications, and backends. I am currently focusing on using Rust & Typescript using svelte for frontend for most of my projects, Open to use other languages when best suited or required for a contribution.

I am currently working 4 days per week at a C# & Azure Company, UPDATE December 2025: we are now pivoting to databricks & datawarehouses so i guess im a python dev now although most work is in requirements and shit.

### Other interests

Although i primarily do programming i do enjoy cosplaying as a maker i own a 3d printer do some soldering sometimes, create custom 3d designs using Fusion360, hack around with a flipper zero and play automation games like Factorio and modded Minecraft (GTNH lol).

Around every christmas i also do a modded Terraria Calamity playthrough with a couple other friends

Favorite "maker" projects i made:
- Created a printing library for a thermal [label printer](https://github.com/Tricked-dev/printer-livestream) and hooked it up to a twitch live stream
- Created driver for another label printer with a display to print their printing language from my console & linux and made it display a rickroll on the internal printer display
- Created a [Wled light panels](/assets/PXL_20250331_125406114.jpg#preview) that turn on and off depending on the state of my machine

And of-course Anime and Manhwa shows i recently watched and enjoyed and are not Frieren, JJK, and rezero lol:
- Eminence in shadow
- Bocchie The Rock
- A certain scientific railgun
- Apothocary diaries
- And of-course the entire EVA franchise !!

Currently also learning 日本 as you can probably notice from my latest blog post at the time maybe i'll watch some unique stuff after i get a hand on it

Tbf these all above are still in most top 100 lists but nevertheless a bit more unique
Now manhwa:
- The Greatest estate developer
- The beginning after the end
- Omniscient reader
- SSS-Class revival hunter
These are even less unique but im guessing youve never read a manhwa so these are a good starting point :\)
#### Selfhosting

My main hobby next to development is selfhosting, I enjoy finding new projects on github and putting them on my server at home to use for my own needs, for example im hosting [Kanidm](https://github.com/kanidm/kanidm) as login shield for almost all my services the latest service i am selfhosting is [linkwarden](https://github.com/linkwarden/linkwarden). [Immich](https://github.com/immich-app/immich) is by far my favorite selfhosted service though.

Through this i learned everything from networking to linux tooling & containers

I recently switched my entire homelab from fedora to NixOS and have been having too much fun trying to do everything in the nix language and getting everything uniform it all working great though now!

### Long terms goals

- Get drivers license
- Move to Amsterdam
- Get rich
- Own ram
