## About me

Hi there! My name is Tricked and I am a software developer from the Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±. I have been passionate about programming and technology since I was 14 years old, starting with creating Javascript Discord bots.

Since then, I have gained experience in building a wide range of applications, including websites, user applications, and backends. I am currently focusing on using Rust & Typescript using svelte for frontend for most of my projects, Open to use other languages when best suited or required for a contribution.

I am currently working 4 days per week at a C# & Azure company.

### Other interests

Although i primarily do programming i do enjoy cosplaying as a maker i own a 3d printer do some soldering sometimes, create custom 3d designs using Fusion360, hack around with a flipper zero and play automation games like Factorio and modded Minecraft.

Favorite "maker" projects i made:
- Created a printing library for a thermal [label printer](https://github.com/Tricked-dev/printer-livestream) and hooked it up to a twitch live stream
- Created driver for another label printer with a display to print their printing language from my console & linux and made it display a rickroll on the internal printer display
- Created a [Wled light panels](/assets/PXL_20250331_125406114.jpg#preview) that turn on and off depending on the state of my machine

#### Selfhosting

My main hobby next to development is selfhosting, I enjoy finding new projects on github and putting them on my server at home to use for my own needs, for example im hosting [Kanidm](https://github.com/kanidm/kanidm) as login shield for almost all my services the latest service i am selfhosting is [linkwarden](https://github.com/linkwarden/linkwarden). [Immich](https://github.com/immich-app/immich) is by far my favorite selfhosted service though.

Through this i learned everything from networking to linux tooling & containers
